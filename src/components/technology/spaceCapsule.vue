        <h3>A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's
            atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space
            gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
